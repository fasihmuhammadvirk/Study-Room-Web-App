now we will create an app named base 
cmd: python manage.py startapp base 

at this point django doesnot know that we have created and app so 
go in the main folder file studybud goto settings
add the newly created app base in the INSTALLED_APPS    

'base.apps.BaseConfig'

# now the project knows that we have created the app named 'base'.

#now goto url 

#url handles all the routes in the app 

#the main url.py handle all the core url and the url.py inside the app 
handles the routes of that app

#view on the other hands deals rendering the data and what to show the user when they 
goto a routes or on a specific route.
