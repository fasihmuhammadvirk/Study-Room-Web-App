#add a folder name templates in the main folder.

# inside the templates add a files name home.html
and also add the file name room.html 

#right now django doesnot know about the template so we have to tell
django about the template

#so goto the main project file studybud
inside the folder goto the settings

# now goto the TEMPLATES in the setting and in the TEMPLATES
in the DIRS give BASE_DIR / 'templates' 
what it does is that the BASE_DIR it say goto the base folder
and then inside the base folder access templates.

# now django now the templates exits.

we can use the templates inside the views using render.

### there is a term called templates inheritance.

# if we want to have a navbar and we want to use that navbar in every
template so we can use the template inheritance techninque.

# we can do that by using the 
{%include 'navbar.html' %}
this will add the navbar inside the template we are currently writing the code in e.g home page.

# also to extend the block in the templates what you can do is 

# suppose we have main.html file and inside the file you can add

    {%include 'navbar.html'%}
    {%block content%}
    
    {%endblock%}
# now you can extend this templates in other templates inside other templates

    {%extends 'main.html'%}
    {%block content%}
    <h1>Home Template</h1>
    {%endblock%} 

# you can see that we use the extend tag to extend the template 
  and where to extend the template we use the block content

# you can find the templates tag here
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/templates/


### now if you are working with the larger project you require to have 
  all the template of each app inside the app mean user app shoukd have login signuo
  and admin side should have its own templates

# so we need to create the separeate template for the app.
  the template that are in the main folder are accessiable to all the apps 
  like the navbar.html and the main.html.

# so create a folder named templates in the base app file
  and inside it create another folder with the name of your file
    |___ base
            |
            |__ templates
                    |
                    |__ base
                          |
                          |__ all html files
    it is a weird structure but django has tell us to do it like this.
   now to acess the templates all we have to do is to add appname before the template in the view.
   example: base/home.html

### dynamic routing 
    if we want to access the url or goto another page inside a template.

# goto the url and then with the path like room add str
example: path('room/<str:pk>/',views.room,name="room")
the value above can be anything int etc.

# now inside the view we have to pass another parameter
     def room(request,pk):
        return render(request,'base/room.html)
the value that we pass in the parameter will be acess by the pk.

# for dynamic url we can use the {% url 'url name in url.py%} tag
# example :{% url 'room' pk=3 %}
