actions , we have to define the action 
the action define that in what url the form will go 
if we do not specify the action it will send it to the current url

every form has a crf token send with it

cross site attacks etc

## forms in django ##

we use forms to make it easy for us
we have to create a forms.py file and specify the code of the form their using the classes
first import 
from django.forms import ModelForm
and for what you want to create the forms

like this

from django.forms import ModelForm
from .models import Room


class RoomForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Room
        fields = '__all__'
        # exclude = ['host', 'updated', 'created']

this will create the form to create the room 

we can simply use the form in the html 
like this 

    {{form.as_p}}
as_p means it will wrap all the element of the form in the html p tag

## to sort the item that are create rectently## 

to make the items appear that are create first on the top 
we can do it to make changes in the model 
we have to create a meta class in the model class and specify it 

like this 
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-updated', '-created']

this take a list and in the list we specify how we want to sort 
in the above we want to sort according to the updated and created
if we donot use the - sign it will sort it as the one that are created oldest will appear first



## to redirect to previous page ##
if we want the user to redirect to the previous page irrespective 
where the are currently now we can use the request method 

like this
    <a href="{{request.META.HTTP_REFERER}}">Go Back</a>
